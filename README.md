# Part-Of-Speech Tagger

Part-Of-Speech Tagging for NLP systems using Keras and NLTK. A Part-Of-Speech Tagger (POS Tagger) is a piece of software that reads text in some language and assigns parts of speech to each word (and other token), such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. This project uses Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM, GRU) to achieve this task on sequential data.

## Dataset

You can either download the [Brown Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/nltkdata/brown-corpus) from Kaggle or directly import from NLTK text corpora for training and testing.

## Getting Started

In order to train the model and start tagging, you'll need to install the required python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can open up a terminal and start training the model, tweak your model configuration however you like:

```bash
python train.py
```

Now you are all set up!
